  <p>Hello World. My name is Chalence Safranek-Shrader. I grew up in sunny Los Angeles, California, and
    received my B.S. in astrophysics from UCLA in 2007. In 2014 I was awarded my Ph.D from the University 
    of Texas at Austin where I was jointly advised by Volker Bromm and Milos Milosavljevic. I am currently
    a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley where I work with Christopher McKee and 
    Richard Klein.</p>

 <p>Research wise, I'm interested in understanding how stars form across cosmic time - both at high redshifts and at the
    present day. I tackle this by means of large-scale radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic simulations which follow
  the progression of star formation from large (Mpc/Kpc) scales down to those
  of protostellar disks (tens of AU).  </p>


<p>When not looking at a computer screen, I enjoy cooking, rock climbing, jazz piano, volleyball, 
  food infomercials, Skymall, tennis, and writing brief autobiographical statements for use on my website.</p>
