 <h1>About Me</h1>
<br>
  <p>Hello World. My name is Chalence Safranek-Shrader. I grew up in sunny Los Angeles, California, and
    received my B.S. in astrophysics from UCLA in 2007. In 2014 I was awarded my Ph.D from the University 
    of Texas at Austin where I was jointly advised by Volker Bromm and
Milos Milosavljevic. I then spent some time as a postdoctoral fellow
at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and UC Berkeley where I
worked with Mark Krumholz, Christopher McKee, and 
Richard Klein.</p>

<p>
I am currently a fellow at Insight Data Science where I am pleased to be making the
transition from academia to industry. I am keen to apply my data
analysis, statistics, and machine learning background to tackle
interesting, business-oriented challenges. 


 <p>Research wise, I was primarily interested in understanding how stars form across cosmic time - both at high redshifts and at the
    present day. I tackled this by means of large-scale radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic simulations which followed
  the progression of star formation from large (Mpc/Kpc) scales down to those
of protostellar disks (tens of AU).  </p>



<p>When not looking at a computer screen, I enjoy cooking, rock climbing, jazz piano, volleyball, food infomercials, Skymall, and tennis.</p>
